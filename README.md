# chatmasala
The project aims to have a peer to peer chat application between different machines running Linux, Windows. The user will need to enter the IP address of the chat buddy. No server setup needed. Please note that this is my first attempt at GTK as well as Windows programming! :-) and I'm sure there's a lot of scope for enhancements/optimizations/cleanups/refactoring. Especially the Windows part is a big mess and needs a lot of cleanup.
